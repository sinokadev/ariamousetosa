# The Aria Mousetosa

Aria Maestosa was a very useful and good program. However, the project was discontinued four years ago, the code is outdated, and it has some inconvenient features. I used the program frequently, so I found this disappointing. That is why I created this fork.

This fork will feature several changes:

1. ~~Use CMake instead of Sconstruct~~
2. Switch to Qt instead of wx (if possible)
3. Code modernization (partially completed)
4. Unify input and editing tools
